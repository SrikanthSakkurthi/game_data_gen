Preqs
-----
This generator requires ruby version â‰¥ 1.9, to install ruby 1.9.3 using rvm follow these [instructions](https://gist.github.com/ashrithr/5811037)

Generating the dataset:
----------------------
This generator takes in various options for generating data:

```
Usage: generator.rb [options]
    -l, --lines LINES                number of lines to generate
    -c LinesPerProcess,              number of lines to generate per process (default: 50,000)
        --lines-per-process
    -m, --multiple-tables            generates data in multi-table format
    -p, --output-path PATH           directory path where output should be written to
    -e, --extra-data                 generates additional user information
    -h, --help
```

###Generating data in single table mode:
This mode mocks random user interaction data into single file which can be loaded into a single table.

The following command will generate 100,000 lines into file(s) named `analytics_[process_id].data` at `/tmp` specified by --ouput-path and will mock extra user information (such as name, email, phone, address)

```
ruby generator.rb --lines 100000 --output-path /tmp --extra-data
```

###Generating data in multi table mode:
This mode mocks random user interaction data into multiple files:

* `analytics_customer[process_id]` will store the user information such as (cid, name, gender, age, register_date, country, total_days)
* `analytics_facts[process_id]` will store user-game facts such as (cid, game_played, game_played_time)
* `analyics_revene[process_id]` will store users who pay (cid, payed_date, revenue)

```
ruby generator.rb --lines 100000 --output-path /tmp --extra-data --multiple-tables
```

###Generating data in multi-process mode:
To generate data using multiple processes use `--lines-per-process` option, which will specify lines per process. For example, the following example will generate 75,000 lines with 25,000 lines per process

```
ruby generator.rb --lines 75000 --output-path /tmp --extra-data --multiple-tables --lines-per-process 25000
```

**Note**: *[process_id]* represents id of the invoked process
